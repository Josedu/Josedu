- ⚡ Fun fact: **I'm also a music producer! I've always dreamed of combining my love for music with programming by working on projects like audio programming, sound design, or even creating interactive music experiences for web applications. When I'm not coding or making music, you'll probably find me playing sports, enjoying outdoor activities, or deep in concentration in front of my computer. Oh, and I’m a bit obsessed with finding solutions – I just can't rest until I crack the problem!**
